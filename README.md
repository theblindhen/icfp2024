## Efficiency problems

We solved the efficiency problems by manually inspecting ICFP terms. Problems involving fibonacci numbers, primes, 2-powers, etc. where solved by identifying the corresponding filters. Bit-encoding and Sudoku problems were solved by translation into SAT and integer linear programming problems (solved using GLPK).
