Hello and welcome to the School of the Bound Variable!

Before taking a course, we suggest that you have a look around. You're now looking at the [index]. To practice your communication skills, you can use our [echo] service. Furthermore, to know how you and other students are doing, you can look at the [scoreboard].

After looking around, you may be admitted to your first courses, so make sure to check this page from time to time. In the meantime, if you want to practice more advanced communication skills, you may also take our [language_test].
